# Python Template

**Project description here**

This is a template project so I don't need to keep setting up pre-commit.

## Development

### Installation

**Installation instructions here**

### Formatting

Use pre-commit to enforce formatting, large file checks, etc.

If not already installed in your environment, run:

```bash
conda install pre-commit
```

To install the precommit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Now a series of useful checks will be run before any commit.
